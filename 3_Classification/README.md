We need to have two classification methods.

On word level:

Phonemic: "spoon" as "poon" or "stoon."  
Semantic: "cat" instead of "dog."  
Neologism: "glimber" instead of "table."  
Mixed: "rat" instead of "cat" (semantic) and then changing it to "lat" (phonemic).  
Circumlocution: Instead of saying "pen," they might say, "It's the thing you write with."  
Anomia: Not being able to come up with the word "apple" when seeing the fruit, even though they know what it is.  
Formal: "hat" instead of "cat" (same sound, but not meaning-related).  
Verbal: "book" instead of "pen."  
Jargon: A sentence that makes little to no sense, like "Plino farthing towards the brint."

On paragraph level:  
“non-aphasia,” “non-fluent aphasia,” and “fluent aphasia”
